# Fork-viewer

A webapp for matching pairs to their forks of northcoders sprints

As a tutor I can...

1. paste in students & github usernames from google sheets in this format:
    ```
    Douglas Hellowell douglashellowell
    User Mc Userface username123
    ```
2. Save the students (localstorage)
3. paste in sprint pairs in this format
    ```
    :pear: Douglas Hellowell - User Mc Userface :pear:
    :apple: Soloy Solosson :apple:
    ```
4. select the days sprint (e.g mitches-rare-treasures)
5. View fork data including
    * Who has/hasn't forked
    * When the last push was
    * percentage commits between a pair
    * how many open PRs they have (?) - might be tricky as they don't fork off an NC repo for proj phase (?)
    * ?? more ??
    * plus - includes link to their code
